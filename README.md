# NCXC
NCXC is a noncollinear functional ensemble. NCXC can be devided into two parts which are NCLibXC and NCSelfXC.
NCLibXC is using Libxc to provide collinear functional for our ensemble.
NCSelfXC is tailored for developers where they can develop noncollinear functional based on their collinear ones.
NCXC 1.0 is launched and programmed by Xiaoyu Zhang. Peking University, China. 2024/09/05
