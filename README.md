# NCXC
NCXC is a noncollinear functional ensemble in the framework of KS-DFT.
NCLibXC is using Libxc to provide collinear functional for our ensemble. NCLibxc returns exchange and correlation energy density per electron and 2*2 exchange and correlation energy potential matrix. If you multiply the potential matrix by basis and do integration, you will acquire the xc part of Hamiltonian.
